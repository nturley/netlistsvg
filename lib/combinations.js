/**
 * K-combinations
 *
 * Get k-sized combinations of elements in a set.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   k_combinations(set, k)
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   set: Array of objects of any type. They are treated as unique.
 *   k: size of combinations to search for.
 *
 * Return:
 *   Array of found combinations, size of a combination is k.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 1)
 *   -> [[1], [2], [3]]
 *
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 2)
 *   -> [[1,2], [1,3], [2, 3]
 *
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 3)
 *   -> [[1, 2, 3]]
 *
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 4)
 *   -> []
 *
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], 0)
 *   -> []
 *
 *   k_combinations([1, 2, 3], -1)
 *   -> []
 *
 *   k_combinations([], 0)
 *   -> []

	// Algorithm description:
	// To get k-combinations of a set, we want to join each element
	// with all (k-1)-combinations of the other elements. The set of
	// these k-sized sets would be the desired result. However, as we
	// represent sets with lists, we need to take duplicates into
	// account. To avoid producing duplicates and also unnecessary
	// computing, we use the following approach: each element i
	// divides the list into three: the preceding elements, the
	// current element i, and the subsequent elements. For the first
	// element, the list of preceding elements is empty. For element i,
	// we compute the (k-1)-computations of the subsequent elements,
	// join each with the element i, and store the joined to the set of
	// computed k-combinations. We do not need to take the preceding
	// elements into account, because they have already been the i:th
	// element so they are already computed and stored. When the length
	// of the subsequent list drops below (k-1), we cannot find any
	// (k-1)-combs, hence the upper limit for the iteration:
	combs = [];
	for (i = 0; i < set.length - k + 1; i++) {
		// head is a list that includes only our current element.
		head = set.slice(i, i + 1);
		// We take smaller combinations from the subsequent elements
		tailcombs = k_combinations(set.slice(i + 1), k - 1);
		// For each (k-1)-combination we join it with the current
		// and store it to the set of k-combinations.
		for (j = 0; j < tailcombs.length; j++) {
			combs.push(head.concat(tailcombs[j]));
